# RAISE-25 Competition: AI's Impact on Education, Careers, and Society

## Overview
This project was developed for the RAISE-25 competition hosted by Rutgers Bloustein School. The competition focuses on analyzing news headlines to explore AI's impact on education, careers, and society. The analysis involves natural language processing (NLP), data visualization, and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from text data.

## Features
- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Preprocessing of news headlines to remove noise and standardize text for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical analysis and visualization of word frequencies, trends, and sentiment distributions.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classification of headlines into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments using NLP models.
- **Topic Modeling**: Identification of recurring themes and discussions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and other clustering techniques.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of sentiment trends, word clouds, and topic distributions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **NLTK / spaCy**: Natural language processing
- **TestBlob/vanderSentiment**: Evaluate the sentimental values of AI news
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and text vectorization
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly**: Data visualization
- **Pandas / NumPy**: Data manipulation and statistical analysis
- **WordCloud**: Visualization of text-based data
